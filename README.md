# A Brief & Subjective Introduction to PyTorch
A brief introduction to PyTorch with some subjective emphasis, meant to be presented in a one hour session.

We'll briefly cover some core PyTorch concepts and then go through a simple
classification example.

You can follow on Binder (takes long to build after changes to the repository):

Alternatively, you can clone the repository. The dependencies are:

  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn
  - pytorch
